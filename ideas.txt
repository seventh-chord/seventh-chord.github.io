Just some things I want to write about

 * 2d cross product
 * The simple "minkowski" collision detection in old mapman
 * 5 point perspective rendering??
 * How many splits do you need to draw a curved line so that it looks smooth when rasterized?
 * C-like enum transmutes in rust, when discriminant is invalid (e.g. transmute 3 to enum {A=1,B=2})

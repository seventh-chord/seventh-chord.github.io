<h1 class="title">Windows executables and section alignment</h1>

<p>In general, in an executable, the sections (<code>.text</code>, <code>.data</code>, etc.) are expected to be loaded into separate memory pages. In fact, this is relied upon for features such as setting different read/write/execute permissions for the different sections in an executable, as these properties are set on a per-memory-page basis. When generating an executable file, you (or the compiler/linker) specifies a section alignment, which in general must be greater than or equal to the page size.</p>
<p>On windows, you can however set the section alignment to be lower than the page size (The relevant field in a windows executable is <code>SectionAlignment</code>). This has multiple effects, some of which are unfortunately not directly documented.</p>
<p>For one, it forces the executable files sections to be loaded directly into memory, without sections being moved around. It is worth noting that this means <code>SectionAlignment</code> and <code>FileAlignment</code> must be equal.</p>
<p>It also disables unique permissions per section. For example, a write-protected section will actually be writable. I am not how permissions for the section are actually decided, though it seems like all sections get full permissions in this case. There is unfortunately no mention of this on MSDN…</p>
<p>Lastly, address space layout randomization gets disabled, meaning any RVAs in the executable can be used as absolute addresses.</p>
<p>I assume the reason for this behavior is for backwards compatibility, though that is pure conjecture. For reference, see the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/system/platform/firmware/PECOFF.mspx">MSDN documentation</a> for the PE-format.</p>
<p><em>Note: I’m not sure how the situation is on linux/osx, though from what I gather this behaviour is not present there</em></p>
